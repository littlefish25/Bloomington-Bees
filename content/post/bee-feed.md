Bees can forage up to 2 miles from the hive, but that doesn't mean you never need to feed the bees. Bee feeding is important when you raise bees of your own. Feeders are boxes where bees go to get food for the hive. When starting beekeeping for the first time, you want to feed the bees a special type of syrup called *sugar syrup*. To make a batch of sugar syrup, you'll need to have 25 pounds of sugar, Â¼ cup of Pro Health, and water. All you nee to do is to stir the stuff up real good, using a paint mixer. This'll give you 3 gallons of sugar syrup to feed the bees. Once your hives weigh 100lbs each, stop feeding sugar and begin filling the feeders with water. This frees up more bees to harvest nectar, and produces more honey.
