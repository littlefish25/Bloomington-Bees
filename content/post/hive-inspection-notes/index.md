Whenever I finish a hive inspection, I like to take notes on it. I have special sheets that has... pretty much everything you might need to fill out.

When it comes to using something like this, you need to know how the most important parts work. The part where it says "Located Queen" is so that you can assure yourself that your hive has a queen. The part where it says "Population" is to let you know whether you need to get more honeybees, split the hive, or not. The part where it says "Disease/Pests" is so that you  know that you have an infestation in your hive and what you need to do.

I use this to fill out any important details that I would like to take note on when hive inspecting. You can find this in [Dadant & Sons Inc.](https://www.dadant.com/catalog/m01940-hive-inspection-sheet-notepad) This is how I like to do it, but that doesn't mean that you aren't entitled to your own fancy. This was only an idea of what kind of notes you would like to take.
