For all those nerds who love mythology and beekeeping, I'll tell you about some bee mythology that I found.

### Greek Mythology

* Apollo got his prophesy skills from three bee maidens.
* Apollo's son, Aristaeus, was the beekeeping god. He had a crush on Orpheus' wife, Eurydice. Eurydice wasn't interested in Aristeus, so you can guess how awkward that got. One day, Eurydice walked on a snake that killed her. When some nymphs caught wind of it, they punished Aristaeus by killing all of his bees. You can guess Aristaeus was unhappy about this. To get back his bees, Aristaeus killed eight cows and left them in a grove for nine days. After nine days, suddenly bees start coming out of the corpses and Aristaeus got his hives back.
* Remember the tale about Kronos being so scared of being overthrown by one of his kids that he ate them all and that his wife, Rhea replaced Zeus with a rock and hid him inside a cave on Mount Dicte? Well apparently, there are two versions about the story's connection with bees: In one version, whenever Zeus started crying, the guards that were protecting him would clang their shields to summon bees to attack intruders and feed Zeus honey. In another version, the nymphs that were nurturing Zeus would feed him honey. So either way, Zeus as a baby drank honey.

### Egyptian Mythology

* Bees came from Ra's tears.

### Hittite Mythology

* Telipinu, the god of agriculture, was angry and didn't let anything grow or animals have kids. So, a goddess named Hannahannah sent a bee to find Telipinu. It found him and made him angrier by stinging and waxing him. Another goddess named Kamrusepa did a ritual that sent Telipinu's anger into the Underworld.

As you can see, there are many myths about bees. Although they are kind of interesting. You can find more info on bee mythology by visiting [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bee_(mythology)).
