A while ago, I just put some small hive beetle traps into my hives. If you don't know what a hive beetle is, it's a beetle that likes to eat everything in the hive. You can tell that there's a hive beetle infestation if there are mutilated cell walls (their feces will melt the honeycomb) and you actually see a hive beetle a few times. It's important to make sure that these pests don't destroy your entire hives. I found Don the Fat Beeman's video on how to make small traps for the hive beetles.

**Equipment:**

* A type of shortening (I just used Crisco)
* Plastic boards (the kind that are used for political signs)
* Powdered boric acid
* A teaspoon
* A cutting utensil
* A staple gun

**Directions:**

1. Cut a plastic board into small pieces.
2. Use shortening to cover one side of the plastic board cutout(s).
3. Add a few teaspoons of boric acid inside of the plastic board cutout(s) through the other side.
4. Use Crisco to cover _that_ side of the plastic board cutout(s).
5. Staple the hive beetle trap by the corners onto the middle of the bottom board using the staple gun.

A hive beetle trap last for 3 or 4 months. The shortening will attract hive beetles, the honeybees will trap the hive beetles at the trap, the hive beetles will get exposed to the boric acid and die. If you feel nervous about putting boric acid into your hives, Don the Fat Beeman has more videos on how to make hive beetle traps.
