I know what you're thinking: "Wait, what? We're talking about vikings, now?" Yes and no. Mead is a type of alcoholic drink that's made from honey, seen as sacred to many ancient cultures, such as the vikings. According to [earthineer.com](http://www.earthineer.com/blog/24208/make-mead-like-a-viking-wild-fermented-mead-101), there's a Norse legend about how mead was made and ended up in the hands of mortal men. (You can see the article in the link above.) There's more history about mead other than vikings on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mead).

I'm to young to drink, but I've crossed by a company named [Oliver Winery](https://www.oliverwinery.com) a few times and their mead seems to be the rage around here, so you may want to check them out if you plan to buy some mead. I also found a recipe for making mead, you can find it on [popularmechanics.com](https://www.popularmechanics.com/home/how-to-plans/how-to/a9228/how-to-make-mead-and-drink-like-a-viking-15703126/). So, if you're 21 and in the US, feel free to buy and drink sacred viking alcohol!
