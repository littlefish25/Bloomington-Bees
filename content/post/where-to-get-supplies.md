Getting good beekeeper supplies is important, because you need it to do stuff when beekeeping. Luckily, I know a few places to get reliable beekeeper supplies.

Lets start with hive parts, and wearings. You can get goat-skin gloves, a good smoker, good frames and box-building kits, and a hat-veil at [Kelly's Bee Supplies](https://www.kelleybees.com/). They have possibly the most reliable supplies I know (at least in my opinion).

Next, construction equipment. You can get construction equipment from any hardware store, but I personally suggest [Menards](https://www.menards.com/main/home.html). They have *lots* of construction equipment there as far as I can tell.

Finally, honeybees. You can't easily find someone who sells bees. But, I happen to know someone who does, [Bastin Bees](http://www.bastinhoneybeefarm.com/).

All of these are good places to get reliable bee equipment from. But, that doesn't mean that you *have* to use them. But, if you do go to Bastin Bees, tell them I said "hi".
