Two days ago, I tried a recipe for home-made pizza from the book "How to Bake". I added a couple of ingredients and made a pepperoni pizza. My mom and step-dad ended up liking it. I will tell you how to make the pizza in this post.

### Ingredients

**For the dough:**

* 2½ cups of unbleached bread or all purpose flour
* 1 teaspoon of salt
* 1 cup of warm faucet water (ideally about 110 degrees, but I didn't know how to tell the temperature without a thermometer, so I made an educated guess)
* 2¼ teaspoons of active dry or instant yeast (I just used Fleischmann's Pizza Crust Yeast because that's what I found at _Kroger_)
* 3 tablespoons of olive oil

**For the topping(s):**

* 28 ounces of canned tomatoes
* ½ cup of coarsely grated mozzarella
* ¼ cup of finely granted Parmesan or Romano cheese
* 1 sliced garlic (I forgot this ingredient, but it didn't make such a big difference)
* 1 teaspoon of dried oregano
* 3 tablespoons of olive oil
* (Some pepperoni, if you want to make a pepperoni pizza like I did)
* (Some basil leaves, if you want to be fancy and classy)

**Directions:**

1. Stir the flour and salt together in a big plastic bowl, then make a big gap in the center.
2. Whisk the water and yeast in a small plastic bowl, add 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, then whisk that into the liquid mixture.
3. Pour the liquid mixture into the plastic bowl with the dry mixture and, using a rubber spatula, stir the two together until it turns into one big lump of dough.
4. Beat the dough until it looks smoother, then cover the entire with plastic wrap and wait for an hour to let the dough rise.
5. Get out a pizza pan and cove it with a tablespoon of olive oil so the dough doesn't stick to the pan.
6. Scrape the dough out of the plastic bowl and onto the pizza pan.
7. Cover your hands with olive oil, then spread and flatten out the dough on the pizza pan to give the pizza the right shape. If it's giving you a hard time, give it 5 minutes and then continue.
8. Leave the dough alone for half an hour while you prepare the topping(s).
9. Set one rack at the very top of the oven and one at the very bottom and preheat the oven at 425 degrees.
10. Open the can(s) of tomatoes. When you do, use the lid to squish the juice out of the can and into the sink. Squeeze the tomatoes to get the seeds and more of the juice out.
11. Chop the tomatoes, then put them in a strainer.
12. Collect the rest of your ingredients.
13. (Chop the basil leaves)
14. Spread the tomatoes evenly onto the dough, then do the same with the rest of your toppings in any order you want. You'll want to spread the rest of the olive oil onto the dough last (I forgot to do that two, but it also didn't make such a big difference).
15. Bake the pizza on the bottom rack and wait for 10 minutes to check. When you check the pizza, you'll want to lift the bottom to see how crispy it's getting. If it's getting crispy too fast, put another pan under the pizza pan. If it's not crispy enough, wait another 10 minutes.
16. When the crust is done, and you want to melt the toppings together, put the pizza on the top rack.
17. If the pizza's done the way you like it, turn off the oven, pull the pizza out, and let it cool.
18. Cut the pizza with either a knife or a pizza cutter, and enjoy!

I ended up not liking the pizza I made, but it's most likely that I'm just used to commercial pizza marinara sauce. We'll see when I make another pizza. But, I hope that you'll enjoy this pizza recipe very much.
