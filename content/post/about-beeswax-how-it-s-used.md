Last month, I found a recipe for German pancakes on [Yummly](https://www.yummly.com "Yummly"). I like learning about German culture and I like pancakes, so I thought I might give it a try. It is a super simple recipe with common ingredients, but it was HUGE when it came out of the oven. It looked like some kind of crazy Grand Canyon/tsunami combo! My mom liked it, but now my grandma wants me to make it again when I'm at her place! Here's a link to the [German pancake](https://tastesbetterfromscratch.com/german-pancakes-2/?utm_campaign=yummly&utm_medium=yummly&utm_source=yummly "German pancakes") recipe. Hope you enjoy it!
