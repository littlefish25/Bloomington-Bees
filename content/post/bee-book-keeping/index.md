When you're beekeeping, it's important to keep track of... pretty much everything. That's why I suggest using a binder to record all your hive inspections, debts, how the bees are doing every day, etc. In fact, I already have a bee-binder to book-keep these things!

See how I labled the side of the binder "Bee-Binder"? That's a good way to know which binder I use for beekeeping. And you can just add any kind of design you want on the front, I just put my bee-logo on the front because it fits the theme.

I have a pocket on the cover of my binder to store in some paperwork and hive inspection sheets that I want to keep around.

For the front page, I have an index for all my other stuff. (And as you can see, it isn't complete but I'm trying to come up with more stuff to keep track of.)

For the first chapter, I have my bee notes to keep track of how the bees're doing every day (at least the days I remember to check the bees).

For the second chapter, I have a place to keep track of all my debts and what I bought. This is important because I need to keeptrack of all my debts and make sure to pay them fully.

And for the last chapter, I just put extra sheets of paper in case one of my chapters runs out of room, or I have another debt, and/or hive inspection, etc. So this should give you an idea of a good way to keep track of everything and I hope you have an easy time recording things. (PS, it's good to have white-out in case you make a pen mistake and different colored pens while having a binder like this.)
