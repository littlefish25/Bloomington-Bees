Have you ever bought blueberry honey from a beekeeper and wondered "How did they make this honey blueberry flavored? Did they take out some blueberries and stir it in?" The answer is: no, it's more complex than that. According to my beekeeping mentor, Andrew Kirch, the process of giving honey a specific flavor and texture has to do a lot with timing. You need to replace some honey frames (frames that you're using to harvest honey from) with empty frames when the flower you chose for your honey flavor blooms. If you do this, the honeybees will collect more pollen from that specific flower. You'll need to grow a lot of that flower and know when it blooms. As soon as the flower stops, you'll need to remove the honey frame.

Personally, I'm looking forward to trying this. It's new and interesting to me, and I hope that you feel the same.
