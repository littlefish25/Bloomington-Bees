One of the most important things in beekeeping is remembering to do hive inspections. Hive inspections are when you check the inside of your hives and their frames once every 2 weeks. It's important to know what your bees are doing in their hives and if everything's okay.

When doing a hive inspection, you want to look for eggs and/or larva. If you find any eggs, then that means that the queen has been there in the last 3 days. If you find any larva, then that means that the queen's been there in the last 10 days. It's also important to have a binder to record how your bees are doing and what you did, like refill feeders. You should also record *when* these events happened.
