A few days ago, I tried a new recipe from a book called "How to Bake" that I got for my 16th birthday. It's a recipe for a 7-8 inch easy bread called and Irish soda bread. I made it, but I had to do a lot of improvising because I probably didn't follow the instructions correctly.  So, I had to improvise. I successfully retried the recipe without having to improvise again. I'll tell you how I made it. This recipe will serve up to eight people.

**Ingredients:**

* 3 cups of unbleached all-purpose flour.
* 1 tablespoon of sugar.
* 1 teaspoon of salt.
* 1 teaspoon of baking soda.
* 1 Â½ cups of buttermilk.

**Directions:**

1. Put all of the dry ingredients in a big plastic bowl.
2. Stir the dry ingredients with a rubber spatula until they're well mixed.
3. Add the buttermilk and mix again until well mixed.
4. Cover the top with plastic wrap and let it sit for five minutes.
5. Set up a rack in the middle of the oven without another rack on top and preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
6. Cover a clean counter with flour to not let the dough stick to the surface and knead the dough until it's a smooth ball.
7. Put the dough ball on a cookie pan with wax paper on top to prevent sticking.
8. Cut the dough with a knife across twice about an inch deep and let the dough sit for fifteen minutes.
9. Bake the dough for forty-five minutes and check by sticking a clean toothpick in the middle, if the toothpick comes out clean, it's done.
10. Get the bread out of the oven and let it cool.
11. When cool, cut it into slices and enjoy!

That's how I made an Irish soda bead. I brought it to school yesterday and shared it with my friends. They really liked the bread. I'm considering making another Irish soda bread and bringing it to school next year.
